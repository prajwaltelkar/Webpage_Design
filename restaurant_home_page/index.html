			Bisi Bele Bath
		</div>
		<p>
			Bisi bele bath recipe (stovetop & Instant pot options) – or Bisi Bele huli anna is one of the traditional KARNATAKA RECIPES that is prepared in most kannada speaking homes. The authentic recipe is a no onion and no garlic recipe, as it is a popular and special dish among the vegetarian folks who do not eat onions and garlic. The authentic bisi bele bath recipe does not call for onions, instead fresh coconut or poppy seeds or dry coconut is used.
			Bisi bele bath is also very popular in the tiffin centers of karnataka and is found on almost every vegetarian restaurant. VANGI BATH & TOMATO BATH are also as much popular as this one.

What is bisi bele bath?
Bisi bele bath is a popular dish made with rice, lentils, mix veggies & a special spice powder known as bisi bele bath powder.

Bisi in kannada translates to hot (temperature), bele translates to lentils & bath is a gooey dish. It is also known as bisi bele huli anna in some parts of karnataka. Huli means sour and anna is rice.

Bisi bele bath is dal and rice cooked together with tamarind and spice powders. As the name suggests it has to be served hot. It tastes best when seasoned in ghee and served hot.

There are many modern versions of bisi bele bath. Iam sharing the recipe I got from our Hassan based home cook. I have been cooking this for years now and has always turned out to be the best. This recipe yields bisi bele bath that tastes almost the same that is served in MTR.

			Upma
		</div>
		<p>
			Upma, uppumavu or uppittu is a dish originating from the Indian subcontinent, most common in South Indian,[1] Maharashtrian, and Sri Lankan Tamil breakfast, cooked as a thick porridge from dry-roasted semolina or coarse rice flour.[2] Various seasonings and/or vegetables are often added during the cooking, depending on individual preferences. Today it is popular in most parts of India and is prepared in various ways.The different names for the dish derive from the combinations of the word uppu, meaning salt[3] in many Dravidian languages, and various words for flour: like pindi[4] or mavu.[5] In North India, the dish is called upma. In Maharashtra the dish traditionally had the name saanja in Marathi.Upma is typically made by first lightly dry roasting semolina (called rava or sooji in India). The semolina is then taken off the fire, and kept aside while spices, lentils, onion, ginger, etc are sautéed in oil or ghee. The semolina is then added back to the pan and mixed thoroughly. Boiling water is added, and the mixture is stirred until the semolina absorbs the liquid and becomes fluffy in texture.[6][7]

There are several ways in which upma is made, and the variations are obtained by either adding or removing spices and vegetables. The texture can vary significantly as well, depending on how much water is added to it, and how long the mixture is allowed to remain on the flame thereafter.

			Kesari Bath
		</div>
		<p>
			Kesari bath or kesari baat (Kannada: ಕೇಸರಿ ಬಾತ್) is a sweet Indian food that is common throughout the country. The classic ingredients used for its preparation are semolina, sugar, ghee (usually), water, and milk. The sweet most commonly known as Jonnadula Halwa in certain parts of northern India.

The precise composition of kesari bath varies regionally depending on the availability of ingredients. The dish might be prepared with pineapple[1], banana, mango, coconut,[2] or rice.[3]

Claims to the origin of the dish are made by Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and other regions of South India. The dish is common in the cuisine of Karnataka as well as of multiple regions in South India and is a popular dish during festivals such as Ugadi. The word kesari in multiple Indian languages refers to the spice saffron which creates the dish's saffron-orange-yellow-colored tinge.[3] Though it is a sweet dish, in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu, it is prepared not only as a dessert but also for normal breakfasts. It is also served with uppittu or khara bath, and a serving of both dishes on one plate is popularly called "chow chow bath".

In North India, it is served as a sweet dish called sheera or suji halwa. It is much simpler with little or no ghee, no color or saffron in contrast to the actual traditional recipe of Karnataka. It is commonly known as sheera in Marathi/Hindi, rava kesari in Telugu and Tamil, and suji halwa in North India and Bangladesh.
